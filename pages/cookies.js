    <strong>COOKIE POLICY</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Last updated&nbsp;November 04, 2021</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    This Cookie Policy explains how&nbsp;McIlroy Limited&nbsp;("
    <strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", and
    "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize
    you when you visit our websites at&nbsp;
    <a href="https://reflio.com/">https://reflio.com</a>,&nbsp;("
    <strong>Websites</strong>"). It explains what these technologies are and why
    we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that
    becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
    device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
    in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
    as to provide reporting information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,&nbsp;McIlroy Limited) are
    called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website
    owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
    party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website
    (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that
    set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it
    visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other
    websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We use first&nbsp;and third&nbsp;party cookies for several reasons. Some
    cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to
    operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary"
    cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of
    our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.&nbsp;Third
    parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and
    other purposes.&nbsp;This is described in more detail below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The specific types of first&nbsp;and third&nbsp;party cookies served through
    our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
    that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online
    Properties you visit):
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How can I control cookies?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
    exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
    Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
    categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
    rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
    our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website
    though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
    restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or
    refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your
    web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
    browser's help menu for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of
    targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please

    <strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies are not the only way&nbsp;to recognize or track visitors to a
    website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web
    beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
    graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize
    when someone has visited our Websites&nbsp;or opened an e-mail including
    them. This allows us, for example, to monitor&nbsp;the traffic patterns of
    users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate
    with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an
    online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
    performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In
    many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
    properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared
    Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information
    about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site
    operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the
    settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools
    contained in the&nbsp;
    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
      Website Storage Settings Panel
    </a>
    . You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the&nbsp;
    <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">
      Global Storage Settings Panel
    </a>
    &nbsp;and&nbsp;following the instructions (which may include instructions
    that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
    "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being
    placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
    and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the
    operator of the page you are on at the time).
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of
    Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
    applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection
    with our services or online content.

  <p>
    <strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
    advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about
    your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
    advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They
    may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
    advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web
    beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in
    order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
    potential interest to you. The information collected through this process
    does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
    details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We may update&nbsp;this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
    for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal
    or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy
    regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
    technologies.
