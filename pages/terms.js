    Any dispute&nbsp;arising out of or in connection with this contract,

    shall be referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial
    Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels,

    arbitration shall be&nbsp;Liverpool, United Kingdom.&nbsp;The language of the proceedings

  </p>
  <p>
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
    between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
    no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
    right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis

    Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
    unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
    Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

  </p>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the
    Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire agreement and
    understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
    right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of
    such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent
    permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations
    to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
    damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
    control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is
    determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of
    the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not
    affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is
    no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created
    between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You
    agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of
    having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have
    based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing
    by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
